# Internal contracts v1

These names are the test-first contract for the initial implementation.

## Domain

### Values and enums

- `Direction`: `CHARGE`, `DISCHARGE`, `IDLE`.
- `DataQuality`: `GOOD`, `STALE`, `MISSING`, `BAD`, `SUSPECT`.
- `UnitLifecycle`: `BOOT`, `OBSERVE_ONLY`, `DISARMED`, `ARMED_IDLE`, `ACTIVE`,
  `INHIBITED`, `STOPPING`, `DISCONNECTED`.
- `IntentSource`: `EMERGENCY_STOP`, `MANUAL`, `AGENT`, `OPTIMIZER`, `SCHEDULE`.
- `DecisionStatus`: `AUTHORIZED`, `CLAMPED`, `REJECTED`, `REVOKED`.

`PowerIntent` is immutable and contains id, source, selected unit ids, direction, non-negative watts
(fleet total), duration, server-assigned acceptance monotonic time, server-assigned acceptance
revision, and actor identity. Clients cannot choose ordering metadata. Idle must have zero watts.

`UnitSetpoint` is immutable and contains unit id, direction, non-negative watts, reactive vars,
generation, intent id, and monotonic authorization expiry. Domain power is not constrained by a wire
register. Direction-to-sign conversion and signed 16-bit range enforcement occur only in the
protocol adapter; out-of-range commands are rejected, never wrapped.

`Observation` is immutable and includes unit identity, wall timestamp, monotonic capture time,
sequence, lifecycle, protocol profile, system SOC, BMS SOC, SOH, signed battery watts, pack voltage
and current, dynamic charge/discharge limits, cells, temperatures, active faults/warnings, and a
quality map. Cell data carries its own monotonic capture time and sequence because it is polled less
frequently. Derived properties expose age, cell age, cell min/max/imbalance, and safety-data
completeness.

`ControlPolicy` is immutable, strict, and versioned. It contains static per-unit/fleet limits,
SOC/cell/temperature/imbalance limits, SOC consistency and jump thresholds, telemetry/cell maximum
ages, authorization lifetime, heartbeat interval, ramp limit, stable samples needed to rearm,
reactive limit (zero by default), blocking fault codes, and debug-mode enable (false by default).

## Application ports

- `Clock.wall_now() -> datetime`, `Clock.monotonic() -> float`, async `Clock.sleep(seconds)`.
- `UnitIO.read_holding(address, count)`, `write_registers(address, values)`, `close()`.
- `ObservationRepository.latest(unit_id)`, `all_latest()`, `append(observation)`, `history(...)`.
- `AuthorizationRepository.publish(batch)`, `current(unit_id, now_mono)`, `revoke(...)`.
- `AuditRepository.append(event)`, `recent(limit)`.
- `ScheduleRepository.get()`, `replace(version, entries)`.
- Provider families: `TariffProvider`, `WeatherProvider`, `PvForecastProvider`,
  `LoadForecastProvider`. They publish advisory data only and cannot import control adapters.

## Safety kernel and arbitration

`FleetAllocator.allocate(intent, observations, policy) -> ProposedSetpoints` deterministically
allocates a fleet-total request across selected units using direction-specific headroom, without
reversing direction or multiplying the request, and with an exact sum after capacity clamping.

`SafetyKernel.evaluate(proposed_setpoints, current_observations, previous_observations, policy,
now_mono) -> ControlDecision` is deterministic and side-effect free. Unknown, stale, invalid,
incomplete, contradictory, or implausibly jumping safety data rejects non-zero power. Zero/stop is
always permitted. It applies dynamic device limits, static unit/fleet limits, ramp limits,
SOC/cell/temperature/imbalance constraints and returns stable machine-readable reason codes.

`IntentArbiter.select(intents, now_mono)` removes expired intents and applies priority:
emergency stop > manual > agent > optimizer > schedule > idle. Equal-priority conflicts resolve by
highest server-assigned acceptance revision then stable id ordering. Emergency stop remains latched
until an operator with stop-acknowledge scope acknowledges the exact stop id; acknowledgement removes
the latched stop from the intent repository so it cannot immediately relatch.

`ControlKernel.tick()` obtains the selected intent and current observations, evaluates safety,
audits the decision, and publishes short-lived authorizations. It publishes/revokes a new generation
every cycle. If evaluation or audit persistence fails, it revokes all authorization.

## Unit actor

One `EnergyPodActor` owns one transport. No other object receives that transport.

- Starts in observe-only and verifies profile, identity, expected cell count and stable observations.
- Polls using the selected register-layout strategy and publishes observations.
- Before every non-zero heartbeat it asks `AuthorizationRepository.current(unit_id, now)`.
- It writes only if authorization is current, generation is not older, lifecycle permits control,
  and telemetry sequence matches or exceeds the authorization evidence sequence.
- Replacement/stop increments the generation fence. An older task can never write afterward.
- Write failure revokes locally, attempts one bounded zero write, inhibits the unit, and stops renewal.
- Cancellation/shutdown revokes, fences, attempts bounded zero, closes transport, and relies on
  firmware expiry if zero cannot be delivered.
- Reads and writes are serialized. Heartbeat deadlines have priority over telemetry reads; an overdue
  read is abandoned rather than delaying a heartbeat past its safety margin.

## Protocol adapter

- Explicit `WAVESHARE_RTU_OVER_TCP` profile uses PyModbus `FramerType.RTU`, configurable device id,
  zero-based addresses, FC03 and FC16.
- IoT profile detection: read 7 holding registers at 0x5000; register 0 > 10. String-enable offset 4,
  BIC count offset 5. Unknown profile or unexpected BIC count is observe-only.
- Legacy reads may be decoded for observation, but legacy writes are disabled until separately
  commissioned.
- PQ command is FC16 at 0x0200 with `[1, signed-P, signed-Q]`; stop is `[1,0,0]`.
- Field-specific endianness and scaling come from `PROTOCOL_EVIDENCE.md`; no global endian rule.

## Schedule

Entries are immutable, timezone-aware local windows with day set, action, positive fleet watts,
selected units and effective date range. Cross-midnight windows are supported; overlaps at the same
priority are rejected. Evaluation returns a short-lived schedule intent, never a hardware command.

## API and MCP

- REST is versioned at `/api/v1`; reads require viewer authentication when configured; mutations
  require operator scope; arming requires an interactive operator; maintenance is absent.
- MCP is read-only by default. Optional dispatch tools require explicit configuration and operator
  scope, submit ordinary expiring intents, and cannot arm, change policy, or use debug modes.
- Both adapters depend on one `EnergyService` application facade and never import Modbus classes.
- Errors are `{code, message, details, request_id}`; decisions expose requested, authorized and
  measured power separately.
